# Infinite Loops Website

This is a website dedicated to St. Mary's University's Computer Science club.

Go here to see it run: https://catherineetter.github.io/Infinite-Loops-Website/
# NOTE!!!!
When adding content, add it to the html files located in the /pages directory. Do not include body or html tags when adding your code.

### When testing on your machine:
Due to a security feature of chrome, you must use another browser to test the site or the live preview option provided by the brackets IDE.
It will work fine when hosted by a server (or uploaded to github)

### Referencing Images or Files:
Since the pages are inserted into index.html, write any directories referencing images or files as if that directory was written in index.html instead of the page you are editing.
For example:
instead of ../images/some-image.png in news.html
write images/some-image.png in news.html
