# NOTE!!!!
When adding content, add it to the html files located in the /pages directory. Do not include body or html tags when adding your code.

When testing on your machine:
Due to a security feature of chrome, you must use another browser to test the site or the live preview option provided by the brackets IDE.
It will work fine when hosted by a server (or uploaded to github)
